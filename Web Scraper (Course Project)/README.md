Steps in Execution:
1. First decide on what data we need to scrape and find a suitable website that contains
the data.

2. Next we should enter the URL of the website that contains the data that we require.

3. Now the system is ready to extract the data from the website.

4. Run the interface.py module to start the system and the user is provided with a
Graphical Interface.

5. Once we run the interface.py we are presented with the following:


6. The interface shows three options upon start. Click on the Update button if this is first
time we retrieve the data or we want to update the data that we have.

7. As we click on the update button the program starts to retrieve the data from the
website and stores it in a CSV file.

8. Now that we have the data we can apply data processing methods on it.
